# Python Excercises

This repo is a collection of semi-random excercises in Python, written in
Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook has a particular theme, and ranges from
being physics context heavy to more Python focused.

## Hermite Polynomials

This notebook details the Hermite series and their application to the
harmonic oscillator as basis functions. The aim of this notebook
is to use routines from `scipy` and `numpy` to calculate the Hermite
polynomials of arbitrary order on a grid, and subsequently plot them
using `matplotlib`.

This notebook can potentially be more daunting to those not accustomed
to physics and maths, but the coding required is actually quite simple.

## Text analysis

This notebook works on analyzing the text in a text file, with the application
being in text mining and general Python usage. There are two example text files
that were converted from PDF journal articles, and the aim of this excercise is
to count the occurances of words and plot them up into a histogram.

This notebook is less on science, and focuses more on Python usage.
